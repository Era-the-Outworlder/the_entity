* You decided to check the Readme file.


Heya! I'm Era the Outworlder, thanks for stopping by! Hope you enjoy this, I enjoyed making it. You can pester me, ask for help, or submit bugs at theoutworlder.tumblr.com or better yet at Era the Outworlder#8203 on Discord.

Thanks to the Ukagaka Dream Team community for aid and inspiration.

I owe an unending amount of gratitude to Zarla-s (take a look at those links in the r-click menu) for her English template and tutorial site, without which this never would have been possible. I won't deny I stripped most of her comments out of these files, if you'd like to take a look at them, go grab yourself a clean copy of the original template. Check her out, she does some awesome stuff.

If you're familiar with it already, and the base code included, you'll noticed a few things I changed/added. The biggest thing by far was a new function to teach custom pronouns, so people whose pronouns are like ze/zir can be included (even if though I'm not sure I ever call that envelope in dialogue. Whoops!) because just because I don't know all the possible pronouns, doesn't mean people should feel excluded.

You can feel free to reuse any of my code in other ukagaka, I think I commented anything special I wrote.

I did all the art/animations myself, I'd appreciate if you didn't redistribute them, and if you wish to redistribute the entire ghost with new/additional code, please get in touch.


Anyway, have a nice day!
