//---------------------------Adding Custom Pronouns--------------------------
//This .dic file has to do with setting the user's pronouns when they aren't she/her, he/him, or epicene they/them.
//This file is fairly short, and you shouldn't have any reason to change it, beyond tweaking dialogue.
//I'll probably come back and tweak this over time.
// <3 Era


//--OnTeachCustomPronoun
//This is called from the config menu in the main character's double click menu when the user says they want to use alternative pronouns.
